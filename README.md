# 🚆 ValidRail – Admin & User Validation System (Java CLI)

ValidRail is a **Java-based command-line application** that simulates a secure user validation and registration system for a railway portal.  
It includes admin login, credential updates, full input validation, and file-based data persistence.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Railway systems require secure and structured user data entry. This project simulates an **admin-managed registration system** where:
- Admin credentials are validated and updatable
- User inputs are rigorously validated (name, email, DOB, etc.)
- Validated data is saved in a persistent file (`users.txt`)

---

## 💻 Features

- ✅ Admin Login via `.properties` file  
- ✅ Create New Admin users from the CLI  
- ✅ Full User Registration Form with Validation  
- ✅ Retry on invalid input  
- ✅ Stores data in `users.txt`  
- ✅ Menu-driven navigation  
- ✅ Modular & clean Java code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java (Core, CLI)
- File I/O (`BufferedWriter`, `Properties`)
- Regex (for email, phone validation)
- Scanner for user input
